# Conjur Policy Backend Reference Guide

_Last Updated: 2020-07-20_

The PKI service uses [Conjur](https://conjur.org) as it's persistence and authorization layer. Meaning whenever a new resource is created, read, updated or deleted (CRUD) that a corresponding API call to Conjur will occur.

The PKI service will configure a specific policy branch with the policies below. This default branch is `pki`.

Below are all of the resources generated by the PKI service initialization:

```yaml
- !webservice
- !variable ca/cert
- !variable ca/key
- !variable ca/cert-chain
- !variable crl

# higher level groups
- !group admin
- !group audit
- &admins
  - !group templates-admin
  - !group certificates-admin
  - !group purge-admin
  - !group ca-admin

# endpoint permission groups
- &templates
  - !group list-templates
  - !group read-templates
  - !group create-templates
  - !group manage-templates
  - !group delete-templates
- &certificates
  - !group list-certificates
  - !group read-certificates
  - !group create-certificates
  - !group sign-certificates
  - !group revoke-certificates
- &purge
  - !group purge
  - !group purge-crl
- &ca
  - !group set-ca-chain
  - !group set-ca-signing-key
  - !group set-ca-signing-cert
  - !group generate-ca
```

As you see above, we are creating groups that have the ability to perform actions on large subsets of certificates or templates like `!group read-templates`. Whenever a new template resource is created, the PKI service will make sure the corresponding privilege is set to the `read-templates` group.

Also, some of the groups above will not have privileges applied to them dynamically. Instead, the privilege remains static such as `!group set-ca-chain` or `!group purge` where the groups are just a one-to-one mapping between role and privilege.

Below are the example of these "static" PKI service groups:

```yaml
- !permit
  role: !group list-templates
  resource: !webservice
  privileges:
    - list-templates

- !permit
  role: !group list-certificates
  resource: !webservice
  privileges:
    - list-certificates

- !permit
  role: !group purge
  resource: !webservice
  privileges:
    - purge

- !permit
  role: !group purge-crl
  resource: !webservice
  privileges:
    - purge-crl

- !permit
  role: !group set-ca-chain
  resource: !webservice
  privileges:
    - set-ca-chain

- !permit
  role: !group set-ca-signing-key
  resource: !webservice
  privileges:
    - set-ca-signing-key

- !permit
  role: !group set-ca-signing-cert
  resource: !webservice
  privileges:
    - set-ca-signing-cert

- !permit
  role: !group generate-ca
  resource: !webservice
  privileges:
    - generate-ca
```

Lastly are the grants, this is where the admin groups become members to a bunch of other more granular groups.

The audit is unique as it only has the ability to list and read certificates and templates.

```yaml
- !grant
  roles: *templates
  member: !group templates-admin

- !grant
  roles: *certificates
  member: !group certificates-admin

- !grant
  roles: *purge
  member: !group purge-admins

- !grant
  roles: *ca
  member: !group ca-admins

- !grant
  roles: *admins
  member: !group admin

- !grant
  roles:
    - !group list-templates
    - !group list-certificates
    - !group read-templates
    - !group read-certificates
  member: !group audit
```

## Certificates

### Create

When a certificate is created in the PKI service, the following policy will be loaded in the `pki` policy branch. The certificate is represented as a `!variable` with annotations.

You will see 2 groups are created when a certificate is created `certificates/<SerialNumber>-read` and `certificates/<SerialNumber>-revoke`. These groups will have granular access to the `pki` webservice to `read` or `revoke` this specific certificate. The `!grant` statement at the bottom of the policy shows how granular privileges trickle up to the higher-level `read-certificates` or `revoke-certificates` groups.

```yaml
- !variable
  id: certificates/<SerialNumber>
  annotations:
    Revoked: <Revoked>
    RevocationDate: <RevocationDate>
    RevocationReasonCode: <RevocationReasonCode>
    ExpirationDate: <ExpirationDate>
    InternalState: csasa<InternalState>csasa

# groups related to the privileges
- !group certificates/<SerialNumber>-read
- !group certificates/<SerialNumber>-revoke

# assign the privileges to the groups above
- !permit
  role: !group certificates/<SerialNumber>-read
  resource: !webservice pki
  privileges:
    - read-certificate-<SerialNumber>
- !permit
  role: !group certificates/<SerialNumber>-revoke
  resource: !webservice pki
  privileges:
    - revoke-certificate-<SerialNumber>

# assign global level groups the ability to read and revoke these certificates
- !grant
  role: !group certificates/<SerialNumber>-read
  member: !group read-certificates

- !grant
  role: !group certificates/<SerialNumber>-revoke
  member: !group revoke-certificates
```

### Revoke

Updating specific annotations is the only requirement when certificates are revoked. All metadata of a certificate is stored as annotations.

Below is the policy that is loaded when revoking a certificate:

```yaml
- !variable
  id: "<SerialNumber>"
  annotations:
    Revoked: <Revoked>
    RevocationDate: <RevocationDate>
    RevocationReasonCode: <RevocationReasonCode>
    InternalState: csasa<InternalState>csasa
```

As you see, the `ExpirationDate` is not present in the policy. This is done on purpose. When a policy `PATCH` is executed, the provided annotations will be updated, however, the non-provided annotations will remain untouched.

### Delete

When a certificate is deleted, we must make sure to delete all of the groups that are associated with this certificate:

```yaml
- !delete
  records: 
    - !variable certificates/<SerialNumber>
    - !group certificates/<SerialNumber>-read
    - !group certificates/<SerialNumber>-revoke
```

## Templates

### Create

When a template is created by the PKI service, all metadata is stored as a JSON string as the `!variable`'s secret value.

The following policy will be loaded. 3 groups are being created with the template -- `read`, `manage` and `delete`:

```yaml
- !variable
  id: templates/<TemplateName>

# groups related to the privileges
- !group templates/<TemplateName>-read
- !group templates/<TemplateName>-manage
- !group templates/<TemplateName>-delete

# assign the privileges to the groups above
- !permit
  role: !group templates/<TemplateName>-read
  resource: !webservice pki
  privileges:
    - read-template-<TemplateName>

- !permit
  role: !group templates/<TemplateName>-manage
  resource: !webservice pki
  privileges:
    - manage-template-<TemplateName>

- !permit
  role: !group templates/<TemplateName>-delete
  resource: !webservice pki
  privileges:
    - delete-template-<TemplateName>

# grant the groups accordingly
- !grant
  role: !group templates/<TemplateName>-read
  member: !group read-templates

- !grant
  role: !group templates/<TemplateName>-manage
  member: !group manage-templates

- !grant
  role: !group templates/<TemplateName>-delete
  member: !group delete-templates
```  

## Manage

When a Template is managed, no policy is loaded. The only data modified is the secret value of the template's `!variable` to reflect the change.

## Delete

When a Template is deleted, the template `!variable` and it's 3 corresponding `!groups` will be deleted.

This is the policy that is loaded when a Template is deleted by the PKI service:

```yaml
- !delete
  records: 
    - !variable templates/<TemplateName>
    - !group templates/<TemplateName>-read
    - !group templates/<TemplateName>-managed
    - !group templates/<TemplateName>-delete
```
